# StockbyNews: Predicting Stock Movements from News Headlines

## Overview
**StockbyNews** is a machine learning project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict stock movements based on historical news headlines. The goal is to analyze how news events impact stock prices and predict whether a company's stock will go up or down based on the sentiment and content of daily news headlines. By training a model using historical data, this project aims to build a predictive system that can analyze new headlines and forecast stock price changes.

This project uses **Bag of Words** and **Count Vectorization** techniques to convert text data (news headlines) into numerical features, which are then used by a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict stock price movements. The model's predictions are based on the correlation between historical headlines and stock price changes, with the aim of providing valuable insights for stock market predictions.

## Project Structure

The entire project is contained within a single Jupyter notebook, `main.ipynb`, which includes the following key sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - The dataset containing news headlines and stock price movements is loaded and cleaned.
    - Text preprocessing steps are performed, such as removing punctuations and converting text to lowercase.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
    - **Count Vectorization** is used to convert the text data (news headlines) into numerical features using the Bag of Words approach. This involves breaking down headlines into individual words (or n-grams) and counting their occurrences in the text.

3. **Model Training**:
    - A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on the processed data. The classifier uses multiple decision trees to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease based on the input features (headlines).

4. **Prediction**:
    - The trained model is used to predict stock movements based on new headlines. The model evaluates whether the news will cause a stock to rise or fall.

## Concepts Used

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
    - **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis, including removing punctuations, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
    - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: A method of representing text data as a collection of word frequencies, ignoring grammar and word order but retaining word occurrences.
    - **Count Vectorization**: A technique that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts, where each row represents a document and each column represents a word from the vocabulary.

2. **Machine Learning**:
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. It is used here to classify stock price movements based on features extracted from news headlines.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Stock Movement Prediction**: The trained model will predict whether a stock's price will go up or down based on daily news headlines.

- **Model Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model will be evaluated based on how well it predicts stock price movements on unseen data. The model is expected to provide valuable insights into how news events influence stock prices.

- **Insights from Features**: By analyzing the features used in the model, you can gain insights into which words or topics in news headlines are most correlated with stock price movements.

### Example Expected Output:
```bash
Accuracy: 57.9%
```

This output would indicate that the model correctly predicted stock price movements 85.67% of the time on the test data.
